# Minimization Randomization: Interactive Allocation Demo 
This animation demonstrates **minimization randomization**. The first set of participants are assigned by simple randomization, then subsequent individuals are allocated to the arm (intervention or control) that best reduces imbalance across key factors (e.g., age, sex, sample size). A live dashboard updates in real time, showing group balance and flagging thresholds. It is used to teach or visualize how minimization works to maintain comparability between groups in clinical trials.
